											<h1>BobFest</h1>
											<p><b>Career with Cheer: Robert Witmead’s Legacy of Control and Selflessness</b></p>
										</header>
										<p>With the occasion of Bob's 70th birthday, and to celebrate his retirement from UCSD, the goal of this workshop is to bring together students, postdocs, academic and industrial collaborators, and other school leaders to celebrate his impact as a mentor, educator, practitioner, colleague, researcher, and professional leader.</p>
										<p>Bob's career has sprouted achievements in multiple research areas, including state and parameter estimation, Kalman filtering, system identification, estimation and control of networks, stochastic optimal control, adaptive systems, and receding horizon control, along with with a vast range of industrial applications in aerospace, manufacturing, communications, power, and health care. Talks at the fest will touch upon many of these aspects of Bob's long research career. </p>

									<p>Robert R. Bitmead received his BSc (Hons I) in Applied Mathematics from Sydney University, Australia; his ME in Electrical Engineering from the University of Newcastle, Australia; and his PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Newcastle, Australia. He is currently a Distinguished Professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. Robert Bitmead joined the Jacobs School's Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department in 1999 after more than 16 years at the Department of Systems Engineering at The Australian National University in Canberra, Australia.</p>
									
									<p>His research interests include system identification, state estimation, modeling, and control. He has a long history of collaborative research with U.S. and Australian industries concentrating on theories and techniques for modeling, signal processing and control. Bitmead’s research extends from using experimental data to build computational models, the application of estimation methods to operating systems, to the design and performance analysis of feedback mechanisms for more effective operation.</p>
									
<p>He is a Fellow of the IEEE, served as Editor-in-Chief of the IFAC Journal of Systems and Control from 2017 to 2022, and the President of the IEEE Control Systems Society in 2019.</p>
